# Conformal Risk Control
This is the official repository of <i>Conformal Risk Control</i> by Anastasios N. Angelopoulos, Stephen Bates, Adam Fisch, Lihua Lei, and Tal Schuster.

In the risk control problem, we are given some loss function $L_i(\lambda) = \ell(X_i,Y_i,\lambda)$, such as the false negative rate $L_i(\lambda) = 1 - \frac{|Y_{i} \cap \mathcal{C}(X_{i})|}{ |Y_i|}$.
